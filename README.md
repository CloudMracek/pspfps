# PSPFPS
This is terrible code...

As always....

## Try it out
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/CloudMracek/pspfps/releases) and run it in [PPSSPP](https://www.ppsspp.org/) or on the real hardware it works better in the emulator tho
## Build
Set up [PSPDEV](https://github.com/pspdev/pspdev) (linux and mac only) and run `make`
